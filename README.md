## Project Description
The main concept of this project is the segmentation of Bryq's customers. Using the dataset given by Bryq, we performed a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) followed by a Recency - Frequency - Monetary Value Analysis (RFM). We continued by creating clusters of the customers with the use of Unsupervised Machine Learning. Finally an Early Warning System inform us which customers have a tendency to discontinue their subscription in Bryq. The whole process is visualised in an interactive dashboard made with Stremlit.
